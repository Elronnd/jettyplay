This is a program that will convert a ttyrec to a regular video file.  It is based off of Alex Smith's jettyplay (http://nethack4.org/projects/jettyplay/), and at the moment is functionally equivalent except it has the GUI parts stripped out.  Java 8 is required to compile.  If you have a problem with that, complain to deepy.
